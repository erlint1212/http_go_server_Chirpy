Building a http server scratch using go
Guided project [link](https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-servers-golang)

Would normally not include the internal folder to a public repo, security hazard.

## Tips

* When building a new application from scratch start as monolith, but keep the API and the front-end decoupled logically
* Monolith better for smaller rapidly changing applications, decoupled better for bigger applications that need multiple teams, or building a phone app.

## Expansion ideas

* Add tries data structure to filter out banned words instead of split list check all.
